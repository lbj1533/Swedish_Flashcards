'''
To Do:

currently:

- add function to take a integer input or an escape (will streamline menus)
- add filepath for runner (will define the scope of the cards it can display)
- custom Queue class? (there are a lot of queue functions in the runner class)
- metadata for each file (last 5 average, last attempt)

from helper import *

Runner().start()
